        <h3>how to search</h3>
        <p>
            You can search by element name, symbol, atomic number, category, property, or discovery date.<br> <br>
            A couple of things to know:
            <ul>
                <li>When you start typing, everything will be dimmed or (for mobile users) disappear. 
                    Don't panic. This is normal. 
                    Things re-appear when you delete your query or it finds something that matches the query.</li>
                <li>It's not case sensitive. You can mix-and-match capital and lower case letters as much as you want.
                    If you don't see anything for 'eh', trying 'Eh' won't help.
                </li>
            </ul>
            To search by <strong>symbol</strong>, enter one or two letters. 
            So, 'hy' returns nothing because it's not a chemical symbol for any element.<br> <br>

            To search by <strong>name</strong>, start typing the element name you're after. 
            You can't search by more than one name at a time "carbon" will work, but "carbon and oxygen" won't.<br> <br>

            To search by <strong>discovery date</strong>, the query needs to be in the form "discovered/found before/after/in/during year". 
            You can find all elements that were known about <em>before</em> 1840 by searching "discovered before 1840" OR
            "found before 1840". To find elements that were found <em>in</em> 1840, type "found in 1840" OR "discovered during 1840"
            (There weren't any found that year. Everyone was too busy signing the treaty or something).
            To find elements that have been found since 1840, the query needs to be "discovered after 1840" OR "found after 1840".<br> <br>

            Searching by <strong>atomic number</strong> is easy. Just type "104". <br> <br>

            To search by <strong>category</strong> or <strong>property</strong>, just type the category or property.
            To see all the radioactive elements, search "radioactive". 
            To see the halogens, type "halogen" or "halogens". 
            Alternatively, you can search "group 17", "grp17". 
            In a similar vein "row 3" or "period 3" also works.
            Also, "s-block" or "s block" or "sblock" will show you all the s-block elements. 
        </p>
        <h3>other features</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>you can control the sliders by using the arrow keys</li>
                <li>you can go between element modals using the arrow keys</li>
                <li>you can close the element modal by pressing the esc key</li>
                <li>clicking the celsius button changes the temperature units</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>why does this exist?</h3>
        <p>
            This project was a product of stupidity. 
            I learnt that web pages have a property called "tables" and thought "y'know, the periodic table is a table.
            I could make one for a website". 
            So I did. But it was using the wrong tool.
            It was like drawing the periodic table in Excel. <br> <br>

            Github user <a href='https://github.com/mirlington'>Mirlington</a> pointed out to me that this should be using a <em>grid</em>, 
            not a <em>table</em>.
            He pointed out many other dumb design decisions I made along the way.
            This project would be no where near as good without his help as a consultant. <br> <br>

            The quiz was initially developed as a set of cards produced by <a href='http://piperpat.com'>PIPERS</a>.
            The original plan was for these cards to be sent to high schools.
            But, because the internet exists, all the questions and images were translated into webpages.
            The quiz is now infintely scalable.
